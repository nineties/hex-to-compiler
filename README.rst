zero-to-compiler
================

Overview
--------

This repository is an extension of `planckforth <https://github.com/nineties/planckforth>`_.

It is a personal project for experimenting with compiler bootstrapping, starting
from hand-written machine code and gradually building more capable language
processing tools. The repository primarily serves as a working log and collection
of experiments rather than a polished implementation.

Notes
-----

The project proceeds in small, incremental steps. Each stage depends only on the
artifacts produced in earlier stages, deliberately avoiding the use of external
assemblers, compilers, runtimes, and code generators.

Many parts are exploratory, incomplete, or subject to change. Documentation and
structure may lag behind the actual experiments.

Status
------

Ongoing personal work. No guarantees of completeness, correctness, or stability.
